# DAT

DNA analysis tool is a simple tool that allows for comparison between DNA text files to calculate percent identity or similarity between
the two sequences. Currently the text format excepted reads text until "REF" is encountered to indicate the beginning of the sequence.
The tool also allows for calculation of amino acid composition of RNA based sequences.

The tool is currently a WIP, plans to add DNA amino acid composition, and target sequence location are in the works for implementation.
